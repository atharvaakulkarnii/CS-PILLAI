        Investing in startups can be a daunting experience for new investors and
        beginners. And truth be told there is hardly a comprehensive source that
        teaches them the inside outs of venture building. Most of the time, this
        needs individual research that it is highly probable to result in
        mistakes and misleading investments. For this reason, csPILLAI has
        created an innovative venture building strategy that focuses on pre-seed
        investors and environmentally-friendly practices. But before diving into
        their revolutionary business model let's talk about who they are.
      </p>

      <span class="headername">CS Pillai</span>
      <p class="descblog">
        <a href="index.html" class="hlink">csPILLAI</a> is an India-based
        company with the goal to provide profitable investment opportunities to
        beginning investors. The vision to accommodate carbon neutrality and
        human well-being was put in motion by C's Pillai who during the first
        years managed to successfully innovate more than 30 technologies to meet
        those goals. After his passing, his son continued his legacy by
        innovating many more technologies and expanding their agenda to include
        trade and industrialization of the whole venture building. With this
        vision in mind, csPILLAI is very different from any venture builder in
        the world since it is innovating the industry by offering an
        industrialized venture building opportunity for pre-seed investors. With
        their revolutionary strategy, investors can get access to an inexpensive
        way to build and own a venture and beget a trade sale exit in 540 days.
        So with this one-stop source, pre-seed investors are guided through
        everything they need to know about startup investing and beget from 2X
        to 10X exit gains.
      </p>
      <span class="headername">How they make it happen</span>
      <p class="descblog">
        Their innovative strategy is called the industrialized closed-loop
        Venture Building ecosystem (icVBe) and it incorporates a Client Portal,
        a Web Office, an Innovation Center, and a Commercial Center. Investors
        can submit new business ideas to the icVBe and it will auto-assign tasks
        to the Founding Team, the Core management Team, and the Remote Team,
        resulting in the scientific creation of the brand-new ventures. More
        specifically, when you put down the capital, their industrialized
        closed-loop Venture Building ecosystem forms a JV and makes you (The
        Pre-Seed Investor) and the Venture Builder (csPILLAI) the first
        shareholders or co-owners. The icVBe, also, prepares your newly-created
        venture for premium trade sale exit by creating brand awareness via
        gootycart. The gootycart is the social presence of your innovative
        products. It is an online marketplace where everyone can set their
        online storefront and sell their digital or physical products. It offers
        free business development, marketing, drop-shipping, product return,
        customer-care, and manufacturing support. Product owners do not need any
        entry to list their goods, but there is the option of outsourcing your
        site’s management to the experienced csPILLAI team for a small fee. So
        if you already have your own products you can highly benefit from the
        brand recognition gootycart provides. And for those who are now starting
        with the investment industry, csPILLAI can help them identify profitable
        ventures to promote on gootycart.
      </p>
      <span class="headername">Invest2exit schemes</span>
      <p class="descblog">
        Alongside Gootycart, csPILLAI offers 3 invest-to-exit type venture
        building schemes for investors to start engaging, funding, and owning
        new ventures. Each type comes with different opportunities for pre-seed
        investors.
      </p>
      <span class="headername">Gooty-CI</span>
      <p class="descblog">
        The venture buyers here are Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) firms and
        big corporations that want to invest in new technologies and
        innovations.
      </p>
      <span class="headername">Gooty-SS</span>
      <p class="descblog">
        The buyers here are VC firms and angel investors interested in Scalable
        Startups (SS) that can provide premium exits with profitable gains.
      </p>
      <span class="headername">Gooty-SB</span>
      <p class="descblog">
        Here the venture buyers are new gootycart business owners and aspiring
        individuals longing to own small cash cow ventures. By pre-seeding, you
        can create small businesses that can offer significant gains in a short
        period of time. Gootycart complements these 3 schemes and together they
        form an innovative strategy that ensures important financial gains and
        profitable exits for your investments.
