      <p>
        Here is the Founding-team: the directors, founders, and promoters who
        govern the company's affairs on a day-to-day basis.
      </p>

      <h1>VISIONARY</h1>

      <p>
        He is the beating heart of the team. While everyone in the company is on
        realizing the overall goals and objectives, with the stars in the eyes,
        he organizes to see into the future and articulates that dream to the
        team and others. He convinces the skeptics among the customers, market,
        investors, and inspires the rest of the team. His job is, at all times,
        people-facing and he is all about the big picture. Whether it’s coming
        up with the overall strategy, recruiting and hiring the best talent for
        the company, or making sure that the right people, investors mainly, are
        kept happy. His eyes on the prize, he is always looking to capitalize on
        even the smallest of opportunities. He is always looking to grow and/or
        expanding the business and is ready to adapt and pivot if the
        circumstances call for it. Even if it’s through sheer force of
        character, no setbacks hold him back and barrel forward rallying the
        rest of the team as he goes. He organizes the rest of the team
        continually, and perhaps most importantly, inspires them.
      </p>

      <h1>PRODUCT PERSON</h1>

      <p>
        There is only one thing that he focuses on- product, product, product.
        The brains of the operation, his entire job is to make sure that the
        required tech and hardware is up to scratch. He is the one who knows the
        market and lives and breathes the product. From the get-go, he
        conceptualizes what the design of the product should be like—what people
        should expect and why it’s amazing. He is a problem-solver and always be
        looking for different ways to develop and improve the value of whatever
        he is working on.
      </p>

      <h1>FACILITATOR</h1>

      <p>
        If the visionary is the heart of the founding team, then she is the arms
        and legs. She is simultaneously the doer and the taskmaster of the
        group, setting the pace and making damn sure everyone else keeps up.
        What she doesn’t know she asks, and what can’t be efficiently done
        she’ll put in the hours to hammer it out. While she can see and
        understand the bigger picture, instead she focuses on the smaller scale
        of things. All those detailed bits and pieces, the day-to-day operations
        that need to be done in order for the grand vision to happen. The
        visionary may set up the board, but it’s she, hustler, that moves the
        pieces. She ultimately walks the middle road to fill whatever role is
        necessary until a more suitable replacement can be found. Bear in mind,
        that does not mean that the hustler is replaceable. She makes sure that
        the visionary and hacker stay grounded and working together. They keep
        their eyes on the bottom line and make sure the ship keeps driving
        forward.
