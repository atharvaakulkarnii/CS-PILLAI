      <h3>What are cookies?</h3>

      <p>
        We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files
        stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.
        We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web
        browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile
        device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and
        interactive experience on our website.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served
        directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by
        us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our
        website; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service
        providers on our website, and can be used by such service providers to

      </p>

      <h3>Cookies we use</h3>

      <p>
        Our website uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out

        example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our website and
        help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these
        cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we
        only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
      </p>

      <h4>Functionality Cookies</h4>

      <p>
        These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make when you
        use our website, such as remembering your language preferences,
        remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to
        other parts of our website which you can customize. The purpose of these
        cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid
        you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our
        website.
      </p>

      <h4>Analytics and Performance Cookies</h4>

      <p>
        These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our
        website and how users use our website. The information gathered does not

        our website, the websites that referred them to our website, the pages
        they visited on our website, what time of day they visited our website,

        information. We use this information to help operate our website more
        efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the
        level of activity on our website.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own
        cookies. It is only used to improve how our website works. You can find

        website by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via

      </p>

      <h4>Targeted and Advertising Cookies</h4>

      <p>
        These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show
        advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies
        use information about your browsing history to group you with other
        users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with
        our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them
        to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while
        you are on third party websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target
        advertising at you by visiting
        http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices. If you choose to
        remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but
        they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies
        by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve
        online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may
        still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are
        not listed.
      </p>
